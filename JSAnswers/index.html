  /*Let maxNumber represent the biggest number, set it to zero to start
  While there are still numbers left in the list
  	Look at the next number in the list
  	Compare it to the maxNumber
  		If next number is smaller than maxNumber
  			Set maxNumber to that number
  Report maxNumber as the biggest in the list
  Answer
  a)we are looking for the maxNumber form list of numbers in our array, the next number smaller than max is not the maxNumber,the number>maxNumber is.
  b) we need to find the largest number from the rest of the list we need to compair every number in the list with maxNumber.
